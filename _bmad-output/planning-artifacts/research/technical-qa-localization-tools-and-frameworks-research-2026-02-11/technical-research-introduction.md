# Technical Research Introduction

### Research Significance

The localization industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation. With AI translation volumes growing **218% year-over-year** and **99% of professionals** requiring human-review steps after machine translation, the demand for automated quality assurance has never been higher. Yet the QA tooling landscape remains fragmented — dominated by decade-old desktop tools like Xbench and embedded TMS features that lack the sophistication of modern AI analysis.

This research was conducted to validate the technical feasibility of building a **standalone, AI-powered localization QA web application** — a tool that doesn't exist in the current market. The research goal is threefold: validate the proposed tech stack, identify the best libraries and frameworks for MVP development, and map the broader technology landscape for Phase 2-3 expansion.

### Research Methodology

- **Scope**: 6 research phases covering XLIFF parsing, tech stack validation, integration patterns, architecture, implementation, and synthesis
- **Data Sources**: 30+ web searches verified against live sources on 2026-02-11, supplemented by knowledge base (May 2025 cutoff)
- **Analysis Framework**: Layer-by-layer evaluation with confidence levels (High/Medium-High/Medium)
- **Verification**: Multi-source validation for all critical technical claims; URLs cited for every web-sourced fact
- **Output**: 3 research documents totaling 3,000+ lines of detailed analysis

### Research Goals Achievement

| Goal | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Validate tech stack** | Achieved | All technologies confirmed production-ready; 11 ADR decisions documented |
| **Find best libraries for MVP** | Achieved | `xliff` (55K/wk), Drizzle ORM, Vercel AI SDK v6, Inngest — all verified |
| **Explore Phase 2-3 landscape** | Achieved | Multi-format parsing, batch API, CI/CD integration, enterprise scaling paths documented |
