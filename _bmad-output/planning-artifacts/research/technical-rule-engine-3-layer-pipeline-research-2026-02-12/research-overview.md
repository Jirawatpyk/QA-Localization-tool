# Research Overview

This technical research investigates the architecture and implementation of a Rule-based QA Engine and 3-Layer AI Pipeline for localization quality assurance. The research addresses three critical gaps identified during Product Brief development:

1. **Rule-based Engine Specification** — Implementation details for 10 QA checks, edge cases per language pair, and Xbench parity requirements
2. **3-Layer Pipeline Architecture** — Layer boundary definitions, overlap prevention, deduplication strategies, data flow patterns, and innovation opportunities
3. **Score Aggregation Algorithm** — Score calculation methodology, severity weighting, Economy vs Thorough mode scoring, and interim scoring during progressive processing
