# Story 5.3: Verification & Integration

Status: done

## Story

As a QA lead,
I want end-to-end verification of the entire Epic 5 (Language Intelligence & Non-Native Support) with real AI calls, real DB, real Realtime, and real E2E tests — plus resolution of all tech debt deferred to this story,
So that I can confirm the epic is production-ready with no hidden bugs, no skipped tests, and no unresolved integration gaps.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: End-to-End Epic 5 Integration Flow (Real AI + Real DB)
**Given** a full Epic 5 flow is executed against real infrastructure (no mocks)
**When** the integration test runs:
1. Upload SDLXLIFF file (Thai→English)
2. Pipeline runs L1+L2 (Economy mode) → findings created
3. Non-native reviewer opens review page → LanguageBridge panel shows real AI back-translation
4. Non-native reviewer accepts/rejects findings → `non_native: true` tag auto-applied
5. Non-native reviewer flags a finding for native review → assignment created
6. Native reviewer logs in → sees only assigned findings (RLS enforced)
7. Native reviewer confirms finding → status updated, notification sent
8. Score recalculates after native confirmation
**Then** all 8 steps complete successfully with real data
**And** back-translation cache is populated (verify `back_translation_cache` table has rows)
**And** audit trail has complete entries for all actions
**And** RLS correctly scopes native reviewer visibility (verified by attempting unauthorized access)

### AC2: Back-Translation Context Segments (TD-BT-001)
**Given** `buildBTPrompt` accepts `contextSegments` parameter
**When** `getBackTranslation.action.ts` processes a segment
**Then** it queries adjacent segments (segmentNumber +/- 2) from the same file
**And** passes them as `contextSegments` to `buildBTPrompt`
**And** back-translation quality improves for ambiguous translations (verified by comparing confidence scores with/without context on 5 test segments)
**And** edge cases handled: first/last segments (fewer neighbors), single-segment files (empty context)

### AC3: Responsive Layout E2E Tests Unskipped (TD-E2E-017)
**Given** `e2e/review-responsive.spec.ts` has 28 per-test `test.skip()` calls + 1 suite-level skip (total ~29 skipped stubs, plus 3 active BT-R tests from Story 5.1)
**When** Story 5.1 (LanguageBridge sidebar) and Story 5.2c (native workflow UI) are complete
**Then** all 28 per-test skips are removed and tests pass (desktop, laptop, mobile viewports)
**And** selectors updated for post-5.1/5.2c layout (e.g., `[data-testid="finding-detail-aside"]` may coexist with LanguageBridge sidebar, bare `nav` locators disambiguated)
**And** tests verify: sidebar collapses correctly on narrow viewports, native workflow UI renders correctly, filter bar adapts to viewport width
**And** any test that genuinely cannot pass yet gets a new TD entry (not left as `test.skip()` without ref)

### AC4: Sheet Focus Lifecycle Fix (TD-E2E-018)
**Given** all findings in a file are reviewed (none pending)
**When** auto-advance fires and no pending finding exists
**Then** if Radix Sheet (detail panel) is open, it closes first
**And** then action bar receives focus correctly (not blocked by `aria-hidden`)
**And** E2E test `e2e/review-actions.spec.ts` E-B1 asserts `toBeFocused()` (not weakened `tabindex="0"`)
**And** fix uses either: (a) close Sheet when no pending left, or (b) replace `aria-hidden` with `inert` attribute

### AC5: Shift+J/K Bulk Selection (TD-UX-006)
**Given** a reviewer has findings in the finding list
**When** they press Shift+J or Shift+K
**Then** the selection range extends from the current anchor to the next/previous finding (same as Shift+Click behavior)
**And** `selectRange` is called from the keyboard actions hook
**And** keyboard-only users can perform all bulk selection operations (WCAG SC 2.1.1)
**And** Shift+J/K suppressed in input/textarea/select/modal (Guardrail #28)
**And** `KeyboardCheatSheet.tsx` updated with Shift+J/K entries

### AC6: Viewport Transition selectedId Sync (TD-UX-005)
**Given** a reviewer selects a finding on desktop layout (side-by-side)
**When** the viewport transitions to mobile layout (stacked/Sheet)
**Then** the `selectedId` in the store syncs correctly — the same finding remains selected
**And** the detail panel/Sheet shows the correct finding content
**And** transitioning back to desktop preserves the selection

### AC7: Verification Data Generator Fix (TD-TEST-007)
**Given** `scripts/generate-verification-data.mjs` has 3 bugs causing 25/88 invalid annotations
**When** the script is fixed
**Then** error type assignment validates template compatibility:
- `number_mismatch` only assigned to templates containing `{0}` or similar number placeholders
- `placeholder_mismatch` only assigned to templates containing placeholder syntax
- `glossary_violation` only assigned to templates containing glossary terms from the term list
**And** regenerated `baseline-annotations.json` has 0 invalid annotations
**And** recall metric recalculated on valid annotations only

### AC8: Accordion Glitch Verification (TD-UX-004)
**Given** the accordion 1-frame glitch (activeIndex=0 flash) was identified in Story 4.2
**When** a minor finding is selected while accordion is collapsed
**Then** verify the glitch is cosmetic-only (no functional impact)
**And** if still visible: add `requestAnimationFrame` wrapper around `setActiveFindingId` to batch with accordion expansion
**And** respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (Guardrail #37) — if reduced motion, no transition at all

## Complexity Assessment

**AC count: 8** (at limit)

**Cross-AC interaction matrix:**

| AC | Interacts with | Count | Nature |
|----|---------------|-------|--------|
| AC1 (integration flow) | AC2 (BT context) | 1 | AC2 improves BT quality tested in AC1 step 3 |
| AC2 (BT context) | AC1 (uses real AI) | 1 | Verified during integration flow |
| AC3 (responsive E2E) | AC4 (Sheet fix), AC6 (viewport sync) | 2 | E2E tests exercise both fixes |
| AC4 (Sheet focus) | AC3 (E2E tests cover it) | 1 | Fix verified by E2E |
| AC5 (Shift+J/K) | — | 0 | Independent keyboard feature |
| AC6 (viewport sync) | AC3 (responsive E2E) | 1 | Verified in responsive tests |
| AC7 (data generator) | AC1 (better test data) | 1 | Fixed data improves integration test |
| AC8 (accordion glitch) | — | 0 | Independent cosmetic fix |

**Max cross-AC interactions: 2** (AC3). Well within limit. Most ACs are independent fixes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Fix BT Context Segments — TD-BT-001 (AC: #2)
- [x] 1.1 In `src/features/bridge/actions/getBackTranslation.action.ts`:
  - After fetching the target segment, query adjacent segments: `SELECT sourceText, targetText FROM segments WHERE fileId = ? AND segmentNumber BETWEEN ? AND ? ORDER BY segmentNumber` (segmentNumber +/- 2, exclude self)
  - Use `withTenant()` on the query (Guardrail #1)
  - Pass results as `contextSegments` to `buildBTPrompt()` (replace `[]` on line 153)
  - Handle edge cases: first segment (no preceding), last segment (no following), single-segment file
- [x] 1.2 Update `src/features/bridge/actions/getBackTranslation.action.test.ts`:
  - Add test: segment in middle → 4 context segments returned
  - Add test: first segment → only 2 following segments
  - Add test: single-segment file → empty context array
  - Mock DB to return adjacent segments
- [x] 1.3 Remove the TODO comment: `// TODO(TD-BT-001): wire surrounding context segments (Story 5.2+)`

### Task 2: Implement Shift+J/K Bulk Selection — TD-UX-006 (AC: #5)
- [x] 2.1 In `src/features/review/components/ReviewPageClient.tsx` — `handleReviewZoneKeyDown` handler:
  - **WARNING: j/k use grid `onKeyDown`, NOT `use-keyboard-actions.ts` registry.** Using registry causes double-fire (see FindingList.tsx comment line 282-284). Add Shift+J/K to the SAME `handleReviewZoneKeyDown` handler where plain j/k live
  - When `event.shiftKey && (key === 'j' || key === 'ArrowDown')`: get current `activeFindingIdRef.current`, compute next finding ID from store's `sortedFindingIds`, call `selectRange(currentId, nextId)` from review store
  - When `event.shiftKey && (key === 'k' || key === 'ArrowUp')`: same but previous finding
  - Suppress in input/textarea/select/modal (Guardrail #28) — same check as existing j/k in the handler
  - **Note:** `getActiveFindingId()` / `getNextFindingId()` / `getPrevFindingId()` do NOT exist as functions. Use `activeFindingIdRef.current` for current ID, read `sortedFindingIds` from store `getActiveFs()` for next/prev computation
- [x] 2.2 In `src/features/review/components/KeyboardCheatSheet.tsx`:
  - Add `Shift+J` = "Extend selection down" and `Shift+K` = "Extend selection up" entries
- [x] 2.3 Add unit tests:
  - Test in ReviewPageClient integration test: Shift+J fires selectRange with correct range
  - Test: Shift+K fires selectRange with correct range
  - Test: Shift+J/K suppressed in text input

### Task 3: Fix Sheet Focus Lifecycle — TD-E2E-018 (AC: #4)
- [x] 3.1 **WARNING: `useFocusManagement()` takes ZERO params** — do NOT modify its signature.
  - `autoAdvance(findingIds, statusMap, currentFindingId, actionBarSelector?)` — 4th param is `actionBarSelector?: string`, NOT a callback
  - Fix strategy: wire the Sheet-close logic in `ReviewPageClient.tsx` at the **call site** where `autoAdvance` is invoked, NOT inside the hook
  - In `ReviewPageClient.tsx`: after calling `autoAdvance()`, if return value is `null` (no pending found), call `setSelectedId(null)` + `setMobileDrawerOpen(false)` BEFORE the next `requestAnimationFrame` that focuses the action bar
  - Sheet is derived from `selectedId !== null` (laptop) or `mobileDrawerOpen && selectedId !== null` (mobile). Setting both to null/false closes the Sheet → removes `aria-hidden` → action bar can receive focus
- [x] 3.2 Update `use-focus-management.test.ts`:
  - Test: `autoAdvance` returns `null` when no pending findings → caller should close Sheet
- [x] 3.3 In `e2e/review-actions.spec.ts` — E-B1 test (`[P0] E-B1: should focus action bar when all findings are reviewed`):
  - Current assertion (line ~595): `await expect(actionBar).toHaveAttribute('tabindex', '0')` — weakened workaround
  - Strengthen to `toBeFocused()` now that Sheet closes first and `aria-hidden` no longer blocks

### Task 4: Fix Viewport Transition Sync — TD-UX-005 (AC: #6)
- [x] 4.1 In `src/features/review/components/ReviewPageClient.tsx`:
  - In `handleActiveFindingChange` / viewport transition handler: sync `selectedId` when layout mode changes
  - Pattern: when layout transitions (desktop ↔ mobile), read current `selectedId` from store and ensure detail panel/Sheet reflects it
  - Guard: if `selectedId` is null, don't force-open Sheet
- [x] 4.2 Add unit test: viewport transition preserves selectedId in store

### Task 5: Fix Verification Data Generator — TD-TEST-007 (AC: #7)
- [x] 5.1 In `scripts/generate-verification-data.mjs`:
  - Before assigning `number_mismatch`: verify template contains `{0}`, `{1}`, or similar number placeholder pattern
  - Before assigning `placeholder_mismatch`: verify template contains placeholder syntax (`%s`, `{name}`, `{{var}}`, etc.)
  - Before assigning `glossary_violation`: verify template source text contains at least one glossary term from the active term list
  - If template incompatible → select different error type or different template
- [x] 5.2 Regenerate `docs/test-data/verification-baseline/baseline-annotations.json` with fixed script
- [x] 5.3 Verify 0 invalid annotations: run validation check that every annotated error is actually present in the generated segment

### Task 6: Unskip Responsive E2E Tests — TD-E2E-017 (AC: #3)
- [x] 6.1 In `e2e/review-responsive.spec.ts`:
  - Remove 28 per-test `test.skip()` calls (T1.1 through RT-4c — see TD-E2E-017 for full list)
  - Keep suite-level skip guard (`test.skip(!process.env.INNGEST_DEV_URL)`) — this is intentional infra gate
  - **WARNING: Selectors are stale (pre-5.1 layout).** Must update:
    - `[data-testid="finding-detail-aside"]` — verify coexistence with LanguageBridge sidebar
    - `page.locator('nav').first()` — disambiguate (Story 5.1 adds new nav-like sidebar)
    - Add assertions for LanguageBridge sidebar visibility/collapse behavior
    - Add assertions for native reviewer UI elements (5.2c: confirm/override buttons)
  - 3 existing active BT-R tests (BT-R1, BT-R2, BT-R3 at lines 1053-1119) — verify still passing
- [x] 6.2 Run responsive E2E locally: `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx playwright test e2e/review-responsive.spec.ts`
  - All 28+ tests GREEN
  - Any genuinely failing tests get a NEW TD entry (not re-skip without ref)

### Task 7: Verify Accordion Glitch — TD-UX-004 (AC: #8)
- [x] 7.1 In `src/features/review/components/FindingList.tsx` (around **line 208-232** — NOT 170-195):
  - The two-state coordination is in a `useEffect` triggered by `storeSelectedId`. When minor finding targeted + accordion closed → `setMinorAccordionValue(['minor-group'])` first (line 216/219), then `setActiveFindingId(storeSelectedId)` on re-run after `flattenedIds` updates (line 224)
  - If glitch still visible: wrap `setActiveFindingId` in `requestAnimationFrame` to batch after accordion render
  - If glitch not visible (React Compiler may have fixed it): document as RESOLVED with note
  - Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (Guardrail #37)
- [x] 7.2 Manual check: select minor finding with accordion collapsed → observe no visible flash

### Task 8: End-to-End Integration Test (AC: #1)
- [x] 8.1 Create `e2e/epic5-integration.spec.ts`:
  - Test flow: Upload Thai SDLXLIFF → pipeline (Economy) → review page → BT panel → non-native action → flag for native → native reviewer login → scoped view → confirm → score recalculate
  - Uses real AI (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
  - Uses real DB (Supabase local or cloud)
  - Uses real Inngest (requires `INNGEST_DEV_URL`)
  - Timeout: 120s (AI calls can be slow)
  - Suite skip guard: `test.skip(!process.env.INNGEST_DEV_URL, 'Requires Inngest dev server')`
  - **Follow existing E2E patterns from `e2e/helpers/`:**
    - Use `signupOrLogin()`, `createTestProject()` from `e2e/helpers/supabase-admin.ts`
    - Use `gotoReviewPageWithRetry()`, `waitForReviewPageHydrated()` from `e2e/helpers/review-page.ts`
    - Use `pollFileStatus()`, `queryFindingsCount()`, `queryScore()` from `e2e/helpers/pipeline-admin.ts`
    - `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` — tests share seeded state
    - Unique timestamped emails: `e2e-epic5-${Date.now()}@test.local`
    - PostgREST seeding via `adminHeaders()` + `fetch()` for data setup
    - `beforeAll` with `testInfo.setTimeout(120_000)` for user/project/data setup
    - `afterAll` cleanup via `cleanupTestProject(projectId)` wrapped in try-catch
    - Use `data-testid` selectors (not CSS/tag) to avoid Radix portal issues
- [x] 8.2 Verify assertions:
  - `back_translation_cache` table has rows for reviewed segments
  - `finding_assignments` table has assignment with status='confirmed'
  - `finding_comments` if comment was added
  - `audit_logs` has entries for all state changes
  - `notifications` table has entries for flag + confirm events
  - `review_actions` metadata has `non_native: true` for non-native actions
  - RLS blocks: native reviewer cannot see unassigned findings (verify via separate browser context)

### Task 9: Cross-Feature Review (Guardrail #79) + Quality Gates
- [x] 9.1 Run `npm run type-check` — zero errors
- [x] 9.2 Run `npm run lint` — zero errors
- [x] 9.3 Run `npm run test:unit` — all GREEN
- [x] 9.4 Run `npm run test:rls` — all GREEN (72+ tests)
- [x] 9.5 Run E2E for all Epic 5 specs:
  - `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx playwright test e2e/review-native-workflow.spec.ts`
  - `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx playwright test e2e/review-non-native-tag.spec.ts`
  - `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx playwright test e2e/review-responsive.spec.ts`
  - `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx playwright test e2e/epic5-integration.spec.ts`
- [x] 9.6 Run cross-file review (`feature-dev:code-reviewer`) on: bridge, review features (Guardrail #79)
- [x] 9.7 Update all 7 TD entries to RESOLVED in `tech-debt-tracker.md`

## Post-Implementation: Responsive E2E Systematic Fix (2026-03-29)

### Commits
- `176473f` — fix(review): Sheet not opening at laptop/mobile + E2E responsive 34/34 pass
- `d3f8edf` — fix(review): CR R1 — stale Sheet on J/K, portal isolation, toggle button, BV-768
- (pending) — fix(review): CR R2 — phantom Sheet on mobile→laptop resize + RT-2b assertion

### Production Bugs Fixed (4)
1. **Sheet not opening at laptop/mobile** — `handleActiveFindingChange` only synced `selectedId` at desktop. Fix: separate `onSelect` callback (user click → Sheet) from `onToggleExpand` (J/K nav → no Sheet). Files: `ReviewPageClient.tsx`, `FindingList.tsx`, `FindingCardCompact.tsx`
2. **Sheet width wrong** — CSS specificity: `sm:max-w-sm` (384px) overrode custom 360px/300px tokens. Fix: `sm:` prefix for laptop, `w-[]` for mobile. File: `FindingDetailSheet.tsx`
3. **Touch target < 44px** — `FindingCardCompact` row height 41.77px < WCAG 2.5.8 minimum. Fix: `min-h-11`. File: `FindingCardCompact.tsx`
4. **J/K at laptop = stale Sheet** — `navigateNext`/`navigatePrev` didn't update `selectedId` → Sheet showed old finding. Fix: `onNavigateAway` callback closes Sheet on navigate. Files: `ReviewPageClient.tsx`, `FindingList.tsx`
5. **Mobile close Sheet → resize laptop = phantom re-open** — `selectedId` preserved for toggle button but not cleared on mobile→laptop transition. Fix: render-time `prevLayoutForSheet` sync clears `selectedId`. File: `ReviewPageClient.tsx`
6. **Mobile close clears selectedId** — `handleSheetChange` at mobile cleared `selectedId`, preventing toggle button. Fix: only clear `mobileDrawerOpen`, preserve `selectedId`. File: `ReviewPageClient.tsx`

### E2E Test Fixes (5)
1. **Stale `[data-radix-portal]` selector** — Radix UI v2 doesn't use this attribute. Fix: `[data-testid="finding-detail-sheet"]`
2. **Portal isolation test trivially passing** — CSS descendant selector on same element. Fix: `page.evaluate` DOM traversal (`aside.contains(content)`)
3. **RT-2b incorrect `:not([aria-hidden])` filter** — Radix unmounts, not aria-hidden. Fix: simplified querySelector
4. **MobileBanner regex wrong** — `/mobile|limited/i` didn't match actual text. Fix: `/best review experience.*desktop/i`
5. **Auth session instability** — `signupOrLogin` per test caused flaky failures. Fix: `restoreAuth` cookie reuse
6. **BV-768 missing MobileBanner boundary check** — Added back at 767px

### Systematic Review (2 rounds)
- **CR R1:** 3 agents (prod-reviewer, e2e-reviewer, crossfile-reviewer) — found P1 stale Sheet on J/K, E2E weakened assertions
- **CR R2:** 3 agents — found P1 phantom Sheet on mobile→laptop resize, RT-2b incorrect mechanism
- **Path C intermediate render:** verified theoretical-only risk (action bar state lag 1 frame, ~16ms window, impossible for human to exploit)

### Final Result: 34/34 E2E passed, 0 skipped

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns & Constraints

**Verification story (Guardrail #49):** This is the mandatory last story for Epic 5. Tests real AI, real DB, real Realtime, real E2E. No mocks for the integration test (Task 8). Unit tests for individual fixes (Tasks 1-7) may use mocks.

**E2E environment (feedback-e2e-run-pattern):** Always use `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local --` prefix for E2E commands. Never `export $(grep ...)`.

**withTenant() on every query (Guardrail #1):** The new adjacent segments query in Task 1 MUST use `withTenant()`.

**CRITICAL: j/k keyboard handler is grid onKeyDown, NOT registry.** `FindingList.tsx:282-284` explicitly warns: "J/K/Arrow handlers live on grid onKeyDown — scoped to grid focus. DO NOT also register via useKeyboardActions (document-level) — causes double-fire." Shift+J/K MUST go in `handleReviewZoneKeyDown` in ReviewPageClient.

**CRITICAL: `useFocusManagement()` takes 0 params.** `autoAdvance` returns `string | null` — caller checks for `null` and handles Sheet close externally. The hook has no concept of Sheet/drawer.

**test.skip() rules (Guardrail #43):** After unskipping responsive tests, any test that still can't pass must have a TD entry with TD ID + story ref. No naked `test.skip()`.

**Cross-file review mandatory (Guardrail #79):** This is epic-closing story — run `feature-dev:code-reviewer` on bridge + review features.

### Tech Debt Resolved by This Story

| TD ID | Description | Effort |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| TD-BT-001 | BT context segments not wired | 1-2 hrs |
| TD-UX-006 | Shift+J/K bulk selection | 2-3 hrs |

| TD-E2E-017 | 31 responsive E2E tests skipped | 3-4 hrs |
| TD-UX-004 | Accordion 1-frame glitch verify | 0.5-1 hr |

### Key Implementation Details

**Adjacent segments query (Task 1):**
```typescript
// In getBackTranslation.action.ts — replace line 153
const adjacentRows = await db
  .select({ sourceText: segments.sourceText, targetText: segments.targetText, segmentNumber: segments.segmentNumber })
  .from(segments)
  .where(and(
    withTenant(segments.tenantId, tenantId),
    eq(segments.fileId, segment.fileId),
    between(segments.segmentNumber, segment.segmentNumber - 2, segment.segmentNumber + 2),
    ne(segments.segmentNumber, segment.segmentNumber) // exclude self
  ))
  .orderBy(asc(segments.segmentNumber))

const contextSegments = adjacentRows.map(r => ({
  sourceText: r.sourceText,
  targetText: r.targetText,
  segmentNumber: r.segmentNumber, // Required by ContextSegment type in buildBTPrompt.ts
}))
```

**Shift+J/K in grid keydown handler (Task 2):**
```typescript
// In ReviewPageClient.tsx — handleReviewZoneKeyDown (same handler as plain j/k)
// WARNING: Do NOT use use-keyboard-actions.ts registry — j/k bypass it (FindingList.tsx:282-284)
if (event.shiftKey && (key === 'j' || key === 'arrowdown')) {
  event.preventDefault()
  const currentId = activeFindingIdRef.current
  if (!currentId) return
  const fs = useReviewStore.getState().getActiveFs()
  const ids = fs.sortedFindingIds
  const idx = ids.indexOf(currentId)
  if (idx >= 0 && idx < ids.length - 1) {
    useReviewStore.getState().selectRange(currentId, ids[idx + 1]!)
  }
}
// Mirror for shift+k/arrowup with idx - 1
```

**Sheet close on no pending (Task 3):**
`useFocusManagement()` takes **ZERO params** — `autoAdvance(ids, statusMap, currentId, selectorStr?)` returns `string | null`.
Wire Sheet-close at the **call site** in ReviewPageClient, not inside the hook:

```typescript
// In ReviewPageClient.tsx — where autoAdvance is called
const nextId = autoAdvance(findingIds, statusMap, currentFindingId)
if (nextId === null) {
  // No pending findings left — close Sheet first (removes aria-hidden)
  setSelectedId(null)              // laptop: Sheet derived from selectedId !== null
  setMobileDrawerOpen(false)       // mobile: Sheet derived from mobileDrawerOpen && selectedId
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    document.querySelector<HTMLElement>('[role="toolbar"]')?.focus()
  })
}
```

| `e2e/review-responsive.spec.ts` | Remove 28 `test.skip()` + update stale selectors | AC3 |
| `e2e/review-actions.spec.ts` | E-B1: `toHaveAttribute('tabindex','0')` → `toBeFocused()` | AC4 |

### ATDD Risks / Assumptions for Dev

1. **AC1 E2E ต้องการ real infra** — `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `INNGEST_DEV_URL` ถ้าไม่มี suite จะ skip ทั้งหมด (suite-level guard). Dev ต้อง verify ว่า infra พร้อมก่อน run
2. **AC3 selectors จะ stale** — `review-responsive.spec.ts` เขียนตั้งแต่ Story 4.1d (pre-5.1 layout). Selectors เช่น `page.locator('nav').first()` และ `[data-testid="finding-detail-aside"]` ต้อง update ให้ตรงกับ post-5.1/5.2c layout (LanguageBridge sidebar + native workflow UI). Budget เวลาสำหรับ selector discovery
3. **AC8 อาจ RESOLVED แล้ว** — React Compiler อาจ batch state updates ที่ทำให้ accordion glitch หายไปเอง. Dev ควร verify ด้วย manual check ก่อน → ถ้าไม่เห็น flash ให้ document as RESOLVED + unskip test เป็น pass
4. **AC5 WARNING: j/k handler location** — Shift+J/K ต้องเพิ่มใน `handleReviewZoneKeyDown` (grid `onKeyDown`) ใน ReviewPageClient.tsx เท่านั้น. ห้ามใช้ `use-keyboard-actions.ts` registry — จะเกิด double-fire (FindingList.tsx:282-284 warn ไว้ชัด)
5. **AC4 WARNING: useFocusManagement signature** — hook takes ZERO params. `autoAdvance` returns `string | null`. Sheet-close logic ต้อง wire ที่ call site ใน ReviewPageClient, ไม่ใช่ภายใน hook
6. **AC7 script test (.mjs)** — `generate-verification-data.mjs` ต้อง extract validation functions ออกมาเป็น testable exports ก่อน ถึงจะ test ได้. Dev ต้อง refactor script เล็กน้อย

### Recommended Task Order

1. **Task 1** (AC2: BT context) — independent, foundational for AC1 step 3
2. **Tasks 2-4** (AC5, AC4, AC6: keyboard/focus) — can parallel, share ReviewPageClient.tsx
3. **Task 5** (AC7: data generator) — independent script
4. **Task 6** (AC3: responsive unskip) — depends on Tasks 2-4
5. **Task 7** (AC8: accordion verify) — quick, independent
6. **Task 8** (AC1: E2E integration) — depends on ALL above
7. **Task 9** (quality gates) — final

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context)

### Debug Log References
- BT context test: DB call order mismatch (segment → project → adjacent, not segment → adjacent → project)
- Existing BT tests: needed `between`/`ne`/`asc` in drizzle-orm mock + `segmentNumber` in segment mock data
- AC4 test: `require()` doesn't work for ESM hooks → switched to standard import
- AC8 accordion glitch: RESOLVED — two-effect coordination pattern already prevents flash

### Production Bugs Found During E2E Debugging
| Bug ID | Severity | File | Root Cause | Fix |
|--------|----------|------|-----------|-----|
| 5.2c-AC2-Q2 | P0 | `getFileReviewData.action.ts` | Q2 query returned ALL findings for native_reviewer — no assignment filter (Task 6 marked done but JOIN never implemented) | Pre-query `finding_assignments` → `inArray(findings.id, assignedFindingIds)` on Q2. Empty guard (Guardrail #5) |
| 5.2c-AC2-Filter | P0 | `ReviewPageClient.tsx` | Default filter `pending` hid `flagged` findings for native_reviewer (Task 9.1 marked done but never implemented) | `setFilter('status', 'flagged')` with `isFirstInit` guard (CF-1) |
| CF-2-Count | P0 | `getFileReviewData.action.ts` | `assignedFindingCount` set inside Q9 try-block — Q9 exception → count=0 → banner hidden + filter forced → blank screen | Moved assignment outside Q9, immediately after pre-query (line 176) |

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Task 1 (AC2): Adjacent segments query wired in getBackTranslation.action.ts with withTenant. 4/4 ATDD tests GREEN. Existing 21 BT tests updated and GREEN.
- ✅ Task 2 (AC5): Shift+J/K added to handleReviewZoneKeyDown in ReviewPageClient.tsx. KeyboardCheatSheet updated. 4/4 ATDD tests GREEN.
- ✅ Task 3 (AC4): Double-rAF focus in use-review-actions.ts after setSelectedFinding(null). E-B1 assertion strengthened to toBeFocused(). 2/2 ATDD tests GREEN.
- ✅ Task 4 (AC6): Viewport transition sync — prevLayoutMode pattern syncs selectedId from activeFindingState on desktop→non-desktop transition. 2/2 ATDD tests GREEN.
- ✅ Task 5 (AC7): isTemplateCompatible() function exported from generate-verification-data.mjs. Validates template has required features (placeholders, glossary terms). 4/4 ATDD tests GREEN.
- ✅ Task 6 (AC3): 28 per-test test.skip() removed from review-responsive.spec.ts. Suite-level skip guard kept.
- ✅ Task 7 (AC8): Accordion glitch RESOLVED — two-effect coordination pattern already prevents flash. React Compiler batching further prevents it. 1/1 test GREEN.
- ✅ Task 8 (AC1): epic5-integration.spec.ts tests unskipped. 10 tests ready for real infra run.
- ✅ Task 9: type-check ✓, lint ✓ (0 errors), 1302 review tests GREEN, cross-file review launched.

#### E2E Integration Debugging (2026-03-29 — continuation session)

**Production Bugs Found & Fixed:**
- 🐛 **5.2c AC2 incomplete implementation**: `getFileReviewData` Q2 returned ALL findings for native_reviewer (not scoped to assignments). Task 6 was marked [x] done but JOIN filter was never implemented. Fixed: pre-query `finding_assignments WHERE assigned_to = currentUser.id` → filter Q2 with `inArray(findings.id, assignedFindingIds)`. Empty assignments guard (Guardrail #5).
- 🐛 **5.2c AC2 default filter missing**: `ReviewPageClient` didn't pre-filter to `status: 'flagged'` for native_reviewer (Task 9.1 was marked done but not implemented). Fixed: `setFilter('status', 'flagged')` after `resetForFile` with `isFirstInit` guard to avoid overriding user's filter on F5/RSC re-init (CF-1 fix).
- 🐛 **CF-2: `assignedFindingCount` in Q9 try-block**: Q9 exception → count=0 → banner hidden but filter forced → blank screen. Fixed: moved assignment outside Q9 try-block, immediately after pre-query.

**E2E Test Fixes (5 bugs):**
- Step 5: `comment` → `flagger_comment` (column name mismatch with schema)
- Step 5: Added `review_actions` row for `flag_for_native` (needed by `confirmNativeReview`)
- Step 4: Removed unnecessary page navigation (all PostgREST, SSR flaky)
- Step 6: Accordion `[data-state]` guard — native scoped view has no accordion → `click()` hanged
- Step 6+7: Timeout 60s → 120s (native login + page load needs more budget)
- Step 7: Click `[data-finding-id="${flaggedFindingId}"]` instead of `row.first()` (wrong finding → NOT_FOUND)
- CF-3: `test.skip(!flaggedFindingId)` guard in Steps 6+7

**Debugging approach:** Systematic debugging (Phase 1-4) + `debug-explorer` agent for stacked root cause analysis. 10 E2E runs, root causes traced via diagnostic logging + schema comparison + data flow tracing.

**Result:** E2E 10/10 passed × 2 consecutive runs.
