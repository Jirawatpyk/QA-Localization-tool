# Story 4.4a: Bulk Operations & Decision Override

Status: in-progress

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a QA Reviewer,
I want to bulk accept or reject multiple findings at once and override previous decisions when needed,
So that I can handle large batches of false positives efficiently and correct mistakes without losing audit history.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Multi-Select via Shift+Click and Shift+J/K

**Given** the finding list is displayed in the review panel
**When** the reviewer uses Shift+Click on a finding row, or Shift+J/K to extend selection from the currently focused finding
**Then** selected findings show a checkbox indicator (visible checkmark in a 20px column prepended to each row)
**And** a `BulkActionBar` appears anchored at the bottom of the finding list area: `"[X] findings selected | [Bulk Accept] [Bulk Reject] [Clear Selection]"`
**And** `Ctrl+A` selects ALL findings matching the current filter (including off-screen items, not just viewport-visible) — uses `sortedFindingIds` from store filtered by current `filterState`
**And** pressing `Escape` clears the selection and hides the BulkActionBar (Guardrail #31: selection layer closes before detail panel)
**And** clicking a single finding WITHOUT Shift clears the multi-selection and returns to single-select mode
**And** `aria-selected="true"` is set on selected rows; BulkActionBar has `role="toolbar"` with `aria-label="Bulk actions"`
**And** an `aria-live="polite"` region announces selection count changes: "3 findings selected" / "Selection cleared"

### AC2: Bulk Accept (≤5 findings — no confirmation)

**Given** 3 findings are selected (≤5 threshold)
**When** the reviewer clicks "Bulk Accept" in the BulkActionBar
**Then** all 3 findings transition to their correct new state immediately via the existing state transition matrix:
- `pending` → `accepted`
- `rejected` → `re_accepted`
- `flagged` → `accepted`
- `noted` → `accepted`
- `source_issue` → `accepted`
- `accepted` / `re_accepted` → no-op (skip, do not include in transaction)
- `manual` → no-op (skip)
**And** a single atomic transaction saves all state changes + inserts one `review_actions` row per finding (all sharing the same `batch_id` UUID)
**And** if ANY finding fails (e.g., concurrent modification), the entire transaction rolls back (all-or-nothing)
**And** a single summary toast: "3 findings accepted" (individual per-finding toasts are suppressed)
**And** the score recalculates **once** after the bulk operation completes — a single `finding.changed` Inngest event using the first processed finding's data as payload + optional `batchId` field (NOT 3 separate events) (FR27). See "Inngest Event Strategy for Bulk" in Dev Notes
**And** the selection clears and BulkActionBar hides after successful completion
**And** `aria-live="polite"` announces: "3 findings bulk accepted, score recalculating"

### AC3: Bulk Reject (>5 findings — confirmation required)

**Given** 8 findings are selected (>5 threshold)
**When** the reviewer clicks "Bulk Reject"
**Then** a confirmation dialog (shadcn Dialog) appears: **"Reject 8 findings?"**
**And** the dialog body shows: "This will dismiss them as false positives."
**And** a severity breakdown table: "2 Critical, 3 Major, 3 Minor" (computed from selected findings' current severity)
**And** Cancel + Confirm buttons; Cancel closes dialog, Confirm executes the bulk reject
**And** focus trap is active in the dialog (Guardrail #30)
**And** dialog resets state on re-open (Guardrail #11)
**And** Esc closes the dialog without executing (Guardrail #31: dialog layer closes before BulkActionBar)

**Given** the reviewer confirms the bulk reject
**Then** all 8 findings transition to `rejected` state (same matrix rules as AC2 — skip already-rejected, skip manual)
**And** same atomic transaction + single `batch_id` + single score recalc event as AC2
**And** summary toast: "8 findings rejected"
**And** `feedback_events` rows inserted for AI training (one per rejected finding, same pattern as single `rejectFinding`)

**Note:** The >5 confirmation threshold applies to BOTH Bulk Accept and Bulk Reject equally. AC2 shows ≤5 without confirmation; AC3 shows >5 with confirmation. The action type (accept/reject) does not change the threshold.

### AC4: Decision Override — State Change with Audit Trail

**Given** a finding was previously Accepted (status = `accepted` or `re_accepted`)
**When** the reviewer changes their decision to Reject (or Flag, Note, Source Issue) via the standard single-finding action (hotkey or action bar)
**Then** the finding transitions to the new state per the existing transition matrix (this already works from Story 4.2/4.3)
**And** a new immutable `review_actions` audit entry is created (previous entry is NOT modified) — this already works
**And** an **"Override"** badge (amber pill: `bg-amber-100 text-amber-800`, min-height 20px, `aria-label="Decision overridden"`) appears on the finding in both FindingCard and FindingCardCompact
**And** the badge is shown whenever `review_actions` count for this finding is > 1 (i.e., the reviewer has changed their mind at least once)
**And** if the finding was Rejected and is now Accepted again, the state is `re_accepted` (this already works via transition matrix)

### AC5: Override History View

**Given** a finding has the "Override" badge (has been re-decided)
**When** the reviewer clicks the "Override" badge or views finding history in the detail panel (FindingDetailContent)
**Then** an `OverrideHistoryPanel` section appears in FindingDetailContent showing the full decision trail:
- Each entry: timestamp (formatted as relative time, e.g., "2 min ago"), user display name, `previousState → newState` with state icons + labels
- Entries are ordered newest-first (most recent decision at top)
- All entries are **read-only** (immutable audit trail — no edit/delete buttons)
**And** the history is fetched via a `getOverrideHistory` Server Action that queries `review_actions WHERE finding_id = X ORDER BY created_at DESC`
**And** the panel has `aria-label="Decision history"` and each entry is a list item (`role="list"` + `role="listitem"`)

### AC6: Bulk Operation Audit Trail

**Given** bulk operations and single overrides are performed
**When** each action is recorded in the `review_actions` table
**Then** bulk operations share the same `batch_id` UUID (generated once per bulk action, passed to all rows in the transaction)
**And** single-finding actions have `batch_id = null` (existing behavior, no change)
**And** the `is_bulk` boolean column distinguishes bulk from single actions at the DB level
**And** `metadata` jsonb stores: `{ is_bulk: true, batch_size: N, action_index: i }` for bulk operations (enabling future undo per Story 4.4b)

### AC7: Bulk Operations — Common Behaviors

**Given** any bulk operation (accept or reject) is performed
**When** the operation completes
**Then** `ReviewProgress` component updates: "Reviewed: X/N" increments by the number of successfully processed findings
**And** findings that were no-ops (already in target state, or manual) are excluded from the count and toast message
**And** the selection clears and `selectionMode` returns to `'single'`
**And** focus moves to the first finding row in `sortedFindingIds` (not auto-advance — bulk operation doesn't have a "next pending" concept)
**And** all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (Guardrail #37)
**And** in-flight guard: `isBulkInFlight` ref prevents double-click on Bulk Accept/Reject buttons during execution

## Dev Notes

### Existing Infrastructure (DO NOT recreate)

**Selection Slice (from Story 4.0 — ALREADY EXISTS in `review.store.ts`):**
- `selectedIds: Set<string>` — finding IDs currently selected
- `selectionMode: 'single' | 'bulk'` — UI mode flag
- `toggleSelection(id)` — add/remove from set
- `setSelections(ids: Set<string>)` — replace entire selection
- `clearSelection()` — empty the set
- `setSelectionMode(mode)` — switch modes (clears selectedIds when bulk→single)
- All reset by `resetForFile(fileId)`

**State Transitions (from Story 4.2/4.3 — reuse `getNewState()`):**
- `getNewState(action, currentState)` returns new state or `null` (no-op). **Parameter order: action FIRST, currentState SECOND**
- Transition matrix already handles all 8×5 combinations
- Bulk actions just call `getNewState()` per finding — no new transitions needed

**Server Action Pattern (from Story 4.2 — `executeReviewAction.ts`):**
- `ReviewActionResult` type: `{ findingId, previousState, newState, findingMeta, serverUpdatedAt }`
- `ReviewActionNoOp` type: `{ findingId, currentState, noOp: true }`
- Bulk action does NOT use `executeReviewAction` helper (it's designed for single-finding operations)
- Instead, bulk action writes its own transaction with batch semantics

**Inngest Score Recalc (from Story 2.5/3.0):**
- `finding.changed` event triggers `recalculateScore` function
- Concurrency: `{ key: 'event.data.projectId', limit: 1 }` — serial per project
- For bulk: send ONE event after transaction commits (not N events)
- The recalculate function re-scores ALL findings for the file regardless of how many changed

**Hooks (from Story 4.0/4.2/4.3):**
- `useReviewActions()` — handles single-action dispatch + optimistic UI + auto-advance
- `useKeyboardActions()` — hotkey registry with scope stack
- `useFocusManagement()` — focus trap, auto-advance, escape hierarchy
- `use-review-actions.ts` line 50: `inFlightRef` — single-action guard. Bulk needs separate `isBulkInFlight`

**Components (from Stories 4.1a-d/4.2/4.3):**
- `ReviewPageClient.tsx` — main wiring hub
- `ReviewActionBar.tsx` — single-finding action buttons (A/R/F/N/S/-/+)
- `FindingCard.tsx` / `FindingCardCompact.tsx` — finding row components
- `FindingDetailContent.tsx` — detail panel with action buttons + segment context
- `FindingList.tsx` — master component with filtering/sorting + `sortedFindingIds` sync

### DB Schema Details

**`review_actions` table (`src/db/schema/reviewActions.ts`):**
```
id: uuid PK
findingId: uuid FK → findings.id (onDelete: restrict)
fileId: uuid FK → files.id
projectId: uuid FK → projects.id
tenantId: uuid FK → tenants.id
actionType: varchar(50) — 'accept' | 'reject' | 'flag' | 'note' | 'source' | 'override' | 'add' | 'delete' | 'update_note'
previousState: varchar(50)
newState: varchar(50)
userId: uuid FK → users.id
batchId: uuid NULLABLE — exists but unused for single actions
metadata: jsonb NULLABLE
createdAt: timestamp with timezone
```

**NEW COLUMN: `is_bulk: boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`**
- Only migration needed for this story
- `batchId` already exists (nullable uuid) — no migration needed for that

### Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Context | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Shift+Click | Finding row | Enter bulk mode + add/toggle in selection |
| Shift+J | Finding list focused | Extend selection downward |
| Shift+K | Finding list focused | Extend selection upward |
| Ctrl+A | Finding list focused | Select all filtered findings |
| Escape | Bulk mode active | Clear selection, exit bulk mode |

All shortcuts suppressed in `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `[contenteditable]` (Guardrail #28).

### >5 Threshold Logic

The >5 confirmation threshold is **UI-only** — the server action does not enforce it. This keeps the server action simple and allows future threshold configuration without server changes.

```
Client:
  if (selectedIds.size > 5) → show BulkConfirmDialog → on confirm → call bulkAction
  if (selectedIds.size ≤ 5) → call bulkAction directly

Server:
  bulkAction({ findingIds, fileId, projectId, action }) → always executes, no threshold check
  Max array size: 200 (Zod validation)
```

### Override Badge Logic

The override badge is computed from `review_actions` count per finding, NOT from a dedicated column.

**Definition:** `overrideCount = (raw review_actions COUNT) - 1` — i.e., number of times the reviewer changed their mind (excludes the initial action).

- On initial load: `getFileReviewData` includes `overrideCount` per finding via aggregated query: `COUNT(*) - 1 as override_count ... HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`
- On single action: increment `overrideCount` optimistically (+1 after any state-changing action on a finding that already has at least 1 action)
- On detail panel open: `getOverrideHistory` fetches full trail
- **Badge renders when `overrideCount > 0`** (meaning at least 2 raw `review_actions` entries exist)

**Examples:**
- Finding with 1 `review_actions` row → `overrideCount = 0` → no badge
- Finding with 2 rows (initial accept → then reject) → `overrideCount = 1` → badge shown: "Override"
- Finding with 4 rows → `overrideCount = 3` → badge shown: "Override ×3"

### Inngest Event Strategy for Bulk

**CRITICAL: existing `FindingChangedEventData` type (`src/types/pipeline.ts`) has REQUIRED fields:**
```typescript
// Existing required fields — must ALL be present:
{ findingId, fileId, projectId, tenantId, previousState, newState, triggeredBy, timestamp }
```

**Bulk strategy: use first processed finding as event payload + add optional `batchId`:**
```typescript
// Task 2.5: Extend FindingChangedEventData in src/types/pipeline.ts
batchId?: string  // optional — null for single actions, UUID for bulk

// In bulkAction.action.ts:
const firstProcessed = processedFindings[0]!
await inngest.send({
  name: 'finding.changed',
  data: {
    findingId: firstProcessed.findingId,
    fileId,
    projectId,
    tenantId,
    previousState: firstProcessed.previousState,
    newState: firstProcessed.newState,
    triggeredBy: userId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    batchId, // optional extra field
  },
})
```

The `recalculateScore` handler already re-scores ALL findings for the file — it ignores the specific `findingId`. So one event per bulk operation is sufficient. Handler logic is unchanged.

### Score Recalculation Strategy for Bulk

Single-action flow (existing):
```
executeReviewAction() → commit → try { inngest.send('finding.changed', { findingId, ...requiredFields }) }
```

Bulk-action flow (new):
```
bulkAction() → commit transaction (all findings) → try { inngest.send('finding.changed', { firstFinding.data + batchId }) }
```

### Cross-File Data Flow Analysis (Guardrail #44)

| File A (Producer) | File B (Consumer) | Data Flow | Verification |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `bulkAction.action.ts` | `review.store.ts` | Bulk result → `setFinding()` per finding | Iteration order: use `sortedFindingIds` order for optimistic, not `findingIds` input order |
| `review.store.ts` (selectedIds) | `BulkActionBar.tsx` | Set → count display | `selectedIds.size` is reactive via Zustand selector |
| `review.store.ts` (selectionMode) | `FindingCard.tsx` | Mode → checkbox visibility | Selector: `useReviewStore(s => s.selectionMode)` |
| `bulkAction.action.ts` | `FindingList.tsx` | Bulk success → re-render | Store update triggers re-render via `findingsMap` change |
| `getOverrideHistory.action.ts` | `OverrideHistoryPanel` | History entries → list render | Fresh fetch on panel open (no stale cache) |

### Project Structure Notes

- All new components go in `src/features/review/components/`
- All new actions go in `src/features/review/actions/`
- Validation schemas extend `src/features/review/validation/reviewAction.schema.ts`
- No new Inngest functions needed — reuse existing `finding.changed` event
- No new Zustand stores — extend existing `review.store.ts`
- Migration: `src/db/schema/reviewActions.ts` + `npm run db:generate`

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context)

### Debug Log References

- Fixed `server-only` import in OverrideHistoryPanel → refactored to pass `fetchHistory` as prop
- Fixed `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` for `fetchHistory` prop type
- Fixed 5 ReviewPageClient test files: added bulk store fields + bulkAction mock + overrideCounts
- Fixed getFileReviewData test: withTenant call count 6→7 (Q7 override counts query)
- 2 pre-existing test failures in pipeline (runL2ForFile, runL3ForFile) — unrelated to 4.4a, pass when run individually (flaky in full suite)
- E2E Bug 1: infinite re-render from `useState` render-time adjustment → switched to `useRef` — **root cause ของ "Something went wrong" hydration crash**
- E2E Bug 2: missing `useRef` import → added to import statement
- E2E Bug 3: Zustand function ref in useEffect deps → used `getState()` inside handler
- Audit Bug 4: `incrementOverrideCount` ไม่ถูกเรียกใน single-action → เพิ่มใน `use-review-actions.ts`
- Audit Bug 5: `onOverrideBadgeClick` ไม่ wire ผ่าน `FindingList` → เพิ่ม prop threading
- Misdiagnosis: `server-only` ไม่ใช่ root cause → restored กลับหลัง audit ยืนยัน build+E2E ผ่าน

### Completion Notes List

**Tasks 1-4 (Server-side + Store):**
- DB migration: `is_bulk` boolean column with DEFAULT false on `review_actions`
- `bulkAction.action.ts`: atomic transaction, batch semantics, single Inngest event, feedback_events for reject
- `getOverrideHistory.action.ts`: history ordered newest-first with tenant isolation
- `FindingChangedEventData` extended with optional `batchId`
- Zustand store: `selectRange`, `selectAllFiltered`, `isBulkInFlight`, `overrideCounts`, `addToSelection`

**Tasks 5-13 (Client-side):**
- `BulkActionBar.tsx`: sticky toolbar with accept/reject/clear, spinner, prefers-reduced-motion
- `BulkConfirmDialog.tsx`: shadcn Dialog with severity breakdown for >5 threshold
- `OverrideBadge.tsx`: amber pill with RotateCcw icon, clickable to show history
- `OverrideHistoryPanel.tsx`: decision trail with relative timestamps
- FindingCardCompact: Shift+Click bulk mode, checkbox column, aria-selected, ring highlight
- FindingCard + FindingCardCompact: OverrideBadge wired from store overrideCounts
- ReviewPageClient: full bulk wiring — executeBulk, handleBulkAccept/Reject, optimistic UI + rollback
- `getFileReviewData.action.ts`: Q7 override counts query + FileReviewData type extended

**ATDD Tests:** 20/20 unit tests GREEN (12 bulkAction + 3 getOverrideHistory + 5 store)
**E2E Tests:** 9/9 GREEN (8 tests + 1 setup)

**Production Bugs (found during E2E + systematic audit):**

1. **Infinite re-render loop (Too many re-renders)** — `FindingDetailContent.tsx` ใช้ render-time state adjustment (`useState` + `setPrevFindingId`) เพื่อ reset `showHistory` เมื่อ finding เปลี่ยน. `setPrevFindingId` trigger re-render → `setShowHistory(false)` trigger อีก render → infinite loop. Root cause: `useState` ไม่เหมาะสำหรับ tracking previous value ใน render body. Fix: ใช้ `useRef` แทน — ref ไม่ trigger re-render. **นี่คือ root cause จริงของ "Something went wrong" ที่เจอตอน E2E** (ไม่ใช่ `server-only` ที่ถูก misdiagnose ในตอนแรก)

2. **Missing `useRef` import** — แก้ Bug 1 โดยเปลี่ยนเป็น `useRef` แต่ลืม update import statement → `ReferenceError: useRef is not defined` ตอน runtime.

3. **Zustand store function ใน useEffect deps → re-register loop** — `selectAllFiltered` จาก `useReviewStore((s) => s.selectAllFiltered)` เปลี่ยน reference ทุกครั้งที่ store update (Zustand ใช้ `Object.is` compare → function จาก object ใหม่ = reference ใหม่) → `useEffect` re-run ทุก render → `register` keyboard shortcut ซ้ำ → conflict loop. Fix: ใช้ `useReviewStore.getState().selectAllFiltered()` ภายใน handler แทน subscription.

4. **Override badge ไม่ขึ้นหลัง single-action (production gap)** — `incrementOverrideCount` ถูกเรียกเฉพาะใน bulk action handler (`ReviewPageClient`) ไม่ถูกเรียกใน `useReviewActions` hook สำหรับ accept/reject ธรรมดา → badge ไม่ขึ้น client-side จนกว่าจะ reload page. Fix: เพิ่ม logic ใน `use-review-actions.ts` — ถ้า `currentStatus !== 'pending'` (เป็น re-decision) → increment หรือ set count.

5. **Badge click ไม่ทำงาน (wiring gap)** — `onOverrideBadgeClick` prop ถูกเพิ่มใน `FindingCard` + `FindingCardCompact` แต่ `FindingList.tsx` ไม่ได้ pass prop นี้ลง → optional chaining `?.` ดักเงียบ → click ไม่ทำอะไร. Fix: เพิ่ม prop threading: `ReviewPageClient` → `FindingList` → `FindingCard/Compact`.

**Misdiagnosis (corrected by systematic audit):**
- ~~`server-only` + `'use server'` conflict~~ → **ไม่ใช่ root cause** — `npm run build` ผ่านปกติ + E2E 9/9 GREEN แม้ `server-only` คืนกลับ. `server-only` ถูก restore แล้ว ตรงกับ pattern ของ Server Actions อื่นทั้ง 11 ไฟล์ในโปรเจกต์

**Lessons Learned (new Guardrails):**
- Render-time state reset → **ใช้ `useRef` ไม่ใช่ `useState`** สำหรับ tracking previous value
- Zustand store methods ใน `useEffect` deps → **ใช้ `getState()` inside handler** แทน selector ใน deps
- New prop on component → **ตรวจ parent chain ทั้งหมด** ว่า wire ลงมาครบ (optional chaining ดักเงียบ)
- Override count increment → **ทุก action path** ที่เปลี่ยน state ต้อง increment ไม่ใช่แค่ bulk
