### **Quality Cosmetic**

### Addressing these cosmetic error categories can enhance the overall quality and clarity of the document, ensuring that it adheres to the specified instructions and standards. (This standard process is to be applied to all types of jobs.)

Below is a list of details to be considered when performing cosmetic QA.

| Cosmetic categories need to do | To prevent issues: |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Following the Instructions**:  | **Misinterpretation of Instructions**: Failure to correctly understand or implement specific directives. **Omission of Required Elements**: Missing components or sections that were explicitly instructed to be included. |
| **Following the Style Guide**: | **Incorrect Citation Style**: Failing to follow the prescribed citation format for references or sources. |
| **Run Glossary by Xbench**: | **Missing or Incorrect Terms**: Glossary entries that are missing or inaccurately defined after running through Xbench checks. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Use of different terms for the same concept that does not align with the glossary. |
| **Translation**: Check the translation | **To prevent the issues below** Missing text Missing translation Misspelling/Typo (Thai language) Text format (bold, italic and etc.) Punctuation (based on target language). Inconsistency of terms Capitalization Superscription and Subscription Symbol and Numbering **Improper Margins**: Margins that are either too wide or too narrow, causing layout issues. |
| **Text**: | Check all text to prevent Text is localized except for some specified. Texts are not truncated. Texts are correctly positioned. Texts are displayed correctly. Correct Tag codes Unnecessary space Alignments are correct. A correct line break (especially for the Thai language) |
| **Spacing**: | **Inconsistent Line Spacing**: Variations in line spacing that affect readability. **Improper Margins**: Margins that are either too wide or too narrow, causing layout issues. |
| **Typo in Thai, English, and Numbers**: | **Spelling Errors**: Typos in both Thai and English text that could mislead or confuse readers. **Numeric Mistakes**: Incorrect representation of numbers (e.g., using commas instead of periods for decimal points). |
| **Tag**:  | **The tag is the same as the source**: compare with the source. **Example**: {{caseTitle}}  \<br\>  {{targetPartnerName}} {{sharerName}} {{sharerBadgeId}} {{{evidenceLinks}}} |
| **Formatting**:  | **Inconsistent Font Usage**: Variation in font types, sizes, or weights throughout the document. **Formatting and Graphics (General Format)**: Lack of clear differentiation between headings, subheadings, and body text, making it difficult to follow.   The overall format of the target file corresponds to the original source format. Format, color and graphics are in the correct place. Font and Bullet, style and size are correspondence to the source file. No additional/unnecessary space Make sure that style of quotes (straight, curly or localized) is consistent. Table and graphic fonts are consistent with the whole document. The headings are uniform: the same font style, size, and spacing (top and bottom). The headings appear above the graphics or tables. The fonts used in graphics and tables are consistent throughout. Graphics and tables are completely visible. Graphics do not cover any text. None of the graphics have “slipped” from their intended position. All text in graphics is completely visible. There are no “broken” words in the table cells. |

**Error Categorization**

### **Translation**
